# Project Description

Plant disease detection is a critical project in regard to identification of plant diseases at an early stage, which is crucial for global health and wellbeing. Agricultural production rate plays a vital role in the economic development of a country. So, control on the diseased leaves during the growing stages of plants/crops is a crucial step.
The disease detection, classification and analysis of diseased leaves at an early stage are always helpful in agricultural process. The Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) methods are used for detecting diseases in plants. The features extraction of images uses a deep learning-based model classified the sick and
healthy leaves.

## Installation Guide

Create a new jupiter notebook project in google collab. Add the new_project_1 code in the google collab project. Google collab requires you to mount the google drive so as to access the dataset files. Grant permission to access when asked.

Upload the unzipped dataset on your google drive or you can unzip directly from google collab also. Refer to this post [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49685924/extract-google-drive-zip-from-google-colab-notebook)
For running app.py you need to install python and the dependencies - streamlit, numpy and tensorflow. Once your model has run successfully it will generate a
model_vgg19.h5 file. Save it and move to project root folder, it would be needed to run app.py file.
